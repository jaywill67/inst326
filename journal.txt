Week 1

This week I used Gemini for the first time. It seems like a pretty good AI response program. I mainly used it for 
documentation and for clarification on syntax in Python. Normally I use ChatGPT, but this time I tried giving Gemini 
and Claude a chance. Chat, GPT and other AI’s have been a recurring topic for me this week as my other classes have also 
talked about AI and the ethics and values in different talking points and concerns. People have it. I’ve come to view AI 
more as a tool now. As I’ve had discussions backing that claim. I also used it to make a gym schedule which it completed 
pretty well.
