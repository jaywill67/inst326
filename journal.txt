Week 1

This week I used Gemini for the first time. It seems like a pretty good AI response program. I mainly used it for 
documentation and for clarification on syntax in Python. Normally I use ChatGPT, but this time I tried giving Gemini 
and Claude a chance. Chat, GPT and other AI’s have been a recurring topic for me this week as my other classes have also 
talked about AI and the ethics and values in different talking points and concerns. People have it. I’ve come to view AI 
more as a tool now. As I’ve had discussions backing that claim. I also used it to make a gym schedule which it completed 
pretty well.


Week 2
This week I used AI to help me with problem solving problems. I used it as a helpful tool while working on my Python exercises.
I asked for hints, code snippets, and explanations that helped me understand how to approach each problem and then completed the
code. It helped me understand the right way to structure list operations and conditionals in the right synatx from sources like 
w3school or online python help websites to help me understand syntax in python. I also used Grok to explain some math concepts 
I was struggling to understand, so this allowed me better understand problems where I didn't fully grasp what the question was asking. 

Week 3
This week I used gemini to help explain new python concepts I didn't understand. It was a great experience and allowed to easily 
understand all the concepts I needed to understand to complete my week 3 exercise. Luckily the provided examples allowed me to 
easily intergrate my new found knowledge onto the week exercises and complete it quickly. Gemini was luckily very responsive today and 
offered alternative responses and examples if I still didn't graps the information provided. The link to this chat is located at this 
URL link: https://g.co/gemini/share/22e54ef918f0 . I was debating with trying claude this time but I wanted to give gemini another chance
to see how it compares in it's coding ability and understanding. Next week I do plan to attempt using Claude with assisting my python understanding.

Week 4 
This week I again used gemini by google to help explain python concepts that I didn't fully understand. Gemini has been a very helpful tool
as well as the speed of it's responses is very fast even if my questions are specific or need extra thinking. The examples and outputs
it generated assisted me greatly in learning and comprehending the content I was coding, especially with the new content that I didn't 
fully grasp that quickly. The link to this chat is located at this URL link: https://gemini.google.com/share/97172734167e .

Week 5
This week, I relied on this Gemini conversation to clarify Python concepts I didn’t fully understand. The responses were quick or even for specific
or tricky questions and the examples and outputs we worked through here helped me grasp the new material and apply it to my code. This thread captures 
the discussion and how it supported my learning. The url located for my chat is at: https://gemini.google.com/share/e0772e34a134

Week 6
This week I decided to use Google Gemini's ai chatbot to ask for help in concepts, context, and clarifying the Python coding I was working on. The responses were assisting me and helped in numerous ways. I mainly just asked for examples, outputs, sample code, and how to use the code I was working on. This allowed to easily complete the exercises and allowed me to work through the material and understand it. This thread is the discussion I had with Gemini to support in my learning and completing of the exercises. The url located for my chat is here: https://gemini.google.com/share/b002c10607bc
