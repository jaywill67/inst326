Week 1

This week I used Gemini for the first time. It seems like a pretty good AI response program. I mainly used it for 
documentation and for clarification on syntax in Python. Normally I use ChatGPT, but this time I tried giving Gemini 
and Claude a chance. Chat, GPT and other AI’s have been a recurring topic for me this week as my other classes have also 
talked about AI and the ethics and values in different talking points and concerns. People have it. I’ve come to view AI 
more as a tool now. As I’ve had discussions backing that claim. I also used it to make a gym schedule which it completed 
pretty well.


Week 2
This week I used AI to help me with problem solving problems. I used it as a helpful tool while working on my Python exercises.
I asked for hints, code snippets, and explanations that helped me understand how to approach each problem and then completed the
code. It helped me understand the right way to structure list operations and conditionals in the right synatx from sources like 
w3school or online python help websites to help me understand syntax in python. I also used Grok to explain some math concepts 
I was struggling to understand, so this allowed me better understand problems where I didn't fully grasp what the question was asking. 

Week 3
This week I used gemini to help explain new python concepts I didn't understand. It was a great experience and allowed to easily 
understand all the concepts I needed to understand to complete my week 3 exercise. Luckily the provided examples allowed me to 
easily intergrate my new found knowledge onto the week exercises and complete it quickly. Gemini was luckily very responsive today and 
offered alternative responses and examples if I still didn't graps the information provided. The link to this chat is located at this 
URL link: https://g.co/gemini/share/22e54ef918f0 . I was debating with trying claude this time but I wanted to give gemini another chance
to see how it compares in it's coding ability and understanding. Next week I do plan to attempt using Claude with assisting my python understanding.

Week 4 
This week I again used gemini by google to help explain python concepts that I didn't fully understand. Gemini has been a very helpful tool
as well as the speed of it's responses is very fast even if my questions are specific or need extra thinking. The examples and outputs
it generated assisted me greatly in learning and comprehending the content I was coding, especially with the new content that I didn't 
fully grasp that quickly. The link to this chat is located at this URL link: https://gemini.google.com/share/97172734167e .

Week 5
This week, I relied on this Gemini conversation to clarify Python concepts I didn’t fully understand. The responses were quick or even for specific
or tricky questions and the examples and outputs we worked through here helped me grasp the new material and apply it to my code. This thread captures 
the discussion and how it supported my learning. The url located for my chat is at: https://gemini.google.com/share/e0772e34a134

Week 6
This week I decided to use Google Gemini's ai chatbot to ask for help in concepts, context, and clarifying the Python coding I was working on. The responses 
were assisting me and helped in numerous ways. I mainly just asked for examples, outputs, sample code, and how to use the code I was working on. This allowed 
to easily complete the exercises and allowed me to work through the material and understand it. This thread is the discussion I had with Gemini to support in 
my learning and completing of the exercises. The url located for my chat is here: https://gemini.google.com/share/b002c10607bc


Week 7
For Week 7, I used Google Gemini’s AI chatbot to get help with Python concepts, context, and clarification. I mostly asked for examples, sample code, expected outputs, 
and guidance on using the code I was writing. The responses were helpful and let me finish the exercises while deepening my understanding of the material. 
You can find the chat thread here: https://gemini.google.com/share/807131a40a3c

Week 8 
On the week of week 8, I again used Google's AI gemini chat response ai prompting system. I used it as an assistant or essentially a helper to lightly guide gudie me through the python coding and completing the 
exercise. I now have the response which now allows me to complete the exercises and furthering my knowledge on the concepts worked upon this week. It luckily didn't overstep and stuck to material I asked it to,
so I didn't even have to explicitly say avoid week 9 material. The chat thread for this week can be located at this URL: https://gemini.google.com/share/88ddd77c1d94

Week 9 
During week 9, I again used Google’s Gemini AI chat response / prompting system. I used it as an assistant or helper to lightly guide me through the Python coding and completing the exercises. I now have the responses, which helped me complete the exercises and further my knowledge of the concepts we worked on this week. It luckily didn’t overstep and stuck to the material I asked it about, so I didn’t even have
to explicitly say to avoid week 10 material. The chat thread for this week can be located at this URL: https://gemini.google.com/share/8d6ffaf4663a

Week 10
In week 10, I continued using Google’s Gemini AI chat tool as a support resource. I treated it like a coding assistant, asking it for light guidance while working through the Python exercises. I’ve saved the replies it generated, which I then used to finish the assignments and deepen my understanding of this week’s concepts. The chat for this week is available at the following link: https://gemini.google.com/share/074ffa231a47

Week 11 
N/A 

Week 12
During week 12, I just used AI in my day to day life. Planning to use it help me plan a proper strategy to complete my final project and make sure I complete it on time with all my other assignments and projects
but still completing everything on schedule.

Week 13
I consulted with AI on how to best finish my project and completing everything on schedule. I asked it to judge my work and make sure it complets the requirements for the rubric and that I didn't miss anything that I should've or anything that I need to add or remove to make sure I'm following the proper requirements of the project submission work.
