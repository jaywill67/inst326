Week 1

This week I used Gemini for the first time. It seems like a pretty good AI response program. I mainly used it for 
documentation and for clarification on syntax in Python. Normally I use ChatGPT, but this time I tried giving Gemini 
and Claude a chance. Chat, GPT and other AI’s have been a recurring topic for me this week as my other classes have also 
talked about AI and the ethics and values in different talking points and concerns. People have it. I’ve come to view AI 
more as a tool now. As I’ve had discussions backing that claim. I also used it to make a gym schedule which it completed 
pretty well.


Week 2
This week I used AI to help me with problem solving problems. I used it as a helpful tool while working on my Python exercises.
I asked for hints, code snippets, and explanations that helped me understand how to approach each problem and then completed the
code. It helped me understand the right way to structure list operations and conditionals in the right synatx from sources like 
w3school or online python help websites to help me understand syntax in python. I also used Grok to explain some math concepts 
I was struggling to understand, so this allowed me better understand problems where I didn't fully grasp what the question
was asking.
